# RISC-V Pipelined Core using TL-Verilog

> A beginner level 5-day workshop on “RISC-V based MYTH” (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours). In the workshop the following topics are discussed namely RISC-V specs, RISC-V software, how to implement RISC-V basic specs using TL-Verilog, simulate your own RISC-V core. The final objective by day 5 is to write RTL and build RISC-V core on my own.
